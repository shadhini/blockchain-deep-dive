{% endhint %}

2013:

* Ideas emerged regarding using blockchain for **other applications** apart from cryptocurrencies

2014:

* **Research and experiments** began that led to **`PoC's`** (proofs of concept) and further research

2015-2017

* **Full-scale trial projects**
* 2015: `Ethereum` was launched; the first smart contract programmable blockchain
* Origin of interest in **enterprise-grade blockchains**&#x20;
* Several projects: `Everledger`, `Quorum`, `Corda`

After 2018:

* Development of **novel monolithic and multichain architectures** rapidly evolved
* Novel protocols: `Solana`, `Avalanche`, `Polkadot`

2022 and onwards:

* trend is expected to grow&#x20;
* more research and development
* more focus on the **regulation, standardisation** and **security**
* numerous projects are already production ready
* more adoption is expected
* development of **layer 2 architectures/solutions** and **multi-chain architectures**
  * led by research on scalability of blockchains; where blockchain can handle many transactions like traditional financial networks&#x20;
  * realised with the help of advancement in making zero-knowledge proofs practical&#x20;
  * under heavy research and development now&#x20;
  * mechanisms introduced: `Plasma`, `rollups`, `sidechains`, `Lightning Network` and etc

Second quarter of 2023:

* Popular Blockchain Applications:
  * Decentralized Finance (`DeFi`)
  * Non-Fungible Tokens (`NFT`s)
