**Proof of Value** (POV) is a tool that helps determine the value of a product or solution for a business based on how customers use it.

A **thick client (**&#x6F;r "fat clients" or "rich clients"**)** is a type of software application or computer system that performs most of its processing on the user's device, rather than relying on a remote server.

They are the opposite of **thin clients**, which rely heavily on server-side processing.
