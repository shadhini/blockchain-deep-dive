# Benefits and Features of Blockchain

## Benefits and Features

### 1. Simplification of current paradigms&#x20;

* The current blockchain model in many industries
  * somewhat disorganised
  * multiple entities maintain their own databases &#x20;
  * data sharing can become very difficult due to the disparate nature of the systems

{% hint style="success" %}
Since a blockchain can serve as **a single shared ledger among many interested parties**

╰**---**➤ it results in simplifying the model by reducing the complexity of managing the separate systems maintained by each entity
{% endhint %}



### 2. Faster dealings

{% hint style="success" %}
Since a **single version of agreed-upon data** is already **available on a shared ledger** between financial organizations

╰**---**➤ Blockchain does not require a lengthy process of&#x20;

&#x20;                       \* verification,&#x20;

&#x20;                       \* reconciliation, and&#x20;

&#x20;                       \* clearance

╰**---**➤ Thus, blockchain enables the quick settlement of trades in financial industry; especially in post-trade settlement functions.
{% endhint %}

.&#x20;

### 3. Cost-saving

{% hint style="success" %}
Since **no trusted third party or clearing house is required** in the blockchain model

╰**---**➤ it massively reduce overhead costs in the form of the fees, which are paid to such parties
{% endhint %}



### 4. Smart property

{% hint style="success" %}
Since it is possible to **link** a **digital or physical asset** to the blockchain in **secure and precise manner;**&#x20;

╰**---**➤ if you own an asset, no one else can claim it unless you decide to transfer it

╰**---**➤ Assets cannot be claimed by anyone else

╰**---**➤ You are in full control of your asset

╰**---**➤ Asset **cannot** be **double-spent** or **double-owned**
{% endhint %}

ℹ️ A usual digital music file, for example, can be copied many times without any controls.



{% hint style="info" %}
Although many **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** schemes are being used currently along with copyright laws,&#x20;

— none of them are enforceable in the way a blockchain-based DRM can be.&#x20;



**Blockchain** can provide _digital rights management_ functionality in such a way that it can be **enforced fully**:&#x20;

— if you own an asset, no one else can claim it unless you decide to transfer it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



### 5. Decentralisation

{% hint style="success" %}
There is **no need for a trusted third party or intermediary** to validate transactions;&#x20;

— instead, a **consensus mechanism** is used to agree on the validity of transactions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



### 6. Transparency and trust

{% hint style="success" %}
Since blockchains are **shared and everyone can see what is on** the blockchain

╰**---**➤ The system is transparent.&#x20;

╰**---**➤ As a result, trust is established.
{% endhint %}

This feature make blockchain suitable for scenarios like **fund/benefit disbursement** where impartial beneficiary selection is crucial.



### 7. Immutability

{% hint style="success" %}
Blockchain data is **practically immutable** due to the immense difficulty in altering it.

╰**---**➤ Can maintain an immutable ledger of transactions

╰**---**➤ Useful in audit and compliance scenarios
{% endhint %}



### 8. High availability

{% hint style="success" %}
Since the system is based on **thousands of nodes in a peer-to-peer network**, and the **data is replicated and updated on every node,**&#x20;

╰**---**➤ The system is highly available (redundancy -> high availability)

╰**---**➤ Even if some nodes leave the network or become inaccessible, the network continues to work.
{% endhint %}



### 9. Highly secure

{% hint style="success" %}
Blockchain technology ensures **data integrity and availability** using **proven cryptographic methods**.&#x20;

* All **transactions** are **cryptographically** **secured** and validated against predefined rules before inclusion in a block.&#x20;
* With private keys and digital signatures, blockchain offers s**ecurity services** like non-repudiation and authentication.
{% endhint %}



### 10. Platform for smart contracts

{% hint style="success" %}
**Smart contracts** **can be** **programmed** to perform any application-level actions&#x20;

╰**---**➤  provides flexibility, speed, security, and automation for real-world scenarios&#x20;

╰**---**➤  that can lead to a completely **trustworthy** system with significant **cost reduction**s
{% endhint %}



## Transparency Vs Confidentiality

> **`Trade off between Transparency and Confidentiality`**
>
> * Blockchain typically prioritises **transparency** over **confidentiality**,&#x20;
>   * this hinder adoption by industries requiring **private and confidential transactions**, such as financial institutions.&#x20;
> * While confidentiality is not always essential—e.g., in Bitcoin's case—there are scenarios where it is desirable.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Solutions like **Zcash** leverage **zero-knowledge proofs** to enable **anonymous transactions**, addressing this limitation.
{% endhint %}
